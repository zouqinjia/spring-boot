# spring-boot
spring-boot特性编写与测试

Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".
We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss.
Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

 $Features$

1、Create stand-alone Spring applications
2、Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)
3、Provide opinionated 'starter' POMs to simplify your Maven configuration
4、Automatically configure Spring whenever possible
5、Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks and externalized configuration
6、Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration
